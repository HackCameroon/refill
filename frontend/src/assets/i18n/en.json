        "46": "In the United Kingdom from 1980 to 1996 there was a risk of being infected with pathogens of the human variant of \"mad cow disease\" (new variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob). These pathogens (prions) can exist undetected in the body for decades. Therefore, people who have been in the United Kingdom for a longer period of time during the above-mentioned period, or who have undergone surgery or transfusions there after 1980, are deferred from donation. Prions are proteins and can be transferred even after sterilisation of multiple surgical tools.",

        "51": "If you have undergone any skin-irritating procedure, such as tattooing, piercing, ear piercing or cosmetic treatment (e.g. permanent make-up), please wait 4 months before donating.",
        "52": "If you have undergone acupuncture or complementary therapy involving the penetration of needles into the skin where disposable needles were not used, please wait 4 months before going to donate blood again",
        "53": "After intravenous or intramuscular drug use - even in the past - donation is no longer possible. For nasal or oral drug consumption and for dry alcoholics the following applies: 12 months after the end of drug or alcohol consumption, you can be admitted to donate blood according to the individual assessment of the donor doctor. In the case of cannabis, there must be no regular (monthly) use and the last use must be more than 1 month ago.",
        "54": "As a result of a dental intervention such as tooth extraction, root resection or treatment of infected dental pockets, you must pause at least one week from donating blood. Once the stitches are removed and everything has healed, you can donate blood again. After cleaning your teeth, you can donate blood again the following day.",
        "55": "After staying in countries with certain infection risks there are waiting periods of 4 weeks (e.g. after visiting West Nile or Chikungunya virus risk areas) or 6 months after visiting a malaria risk area. The length of the waiting period depends on the known infection risks for the destination, the duration of the stay, the exact itinerary and the travel time - for example, some waiting periods apply all year round, while other destinations only become risk areas for certain infectious diseases during the summer months.",
        "56": "The background for the provision is possible, albeit very rare, cases of chronic courses of malaria infections with persistence of the pathogens in the body, but which do not lead to symptoms in the context of a so-called partial immunity. Since the pathogens are present in the blood without triggering disease symptoms, they could be passed on to the blood donor by transfusion.",
        "57": "After birth in a malaria risk area or a continuous stay of more than 6 months in a malaria risk area, you may only donate after presenting a negative test for all malaria pathogens",
        "58": "In principle, vitamins do not interfere with blood donation. There is, however, one exception: thanks to a newly introduced test system, donors will in future be deferred from donating for 12 hours after taking more than 5000 µg of biotin. In order to clarify the donor's ability to donate, donors will now be asked to take biotin at blood donation appointments on site. The vitamin biotin (also called vitamin B7 or vitamin H) is used in very high dosages with the aim of cosmetically improving the skin, nails and hair. It has been observed that dosages of more than 5000 µg (5 mg) per day can lead to disturbances in immunochemical laboratory tests such as those used for the diagnosis of infections. Since the safety of blood products is our highest priority, the above mentioned waiting period of 12 hours was set. If you take biotin, please make sure that you do not take it until after the donation.",
